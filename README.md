# Secured-Auto-Configuration-Using-IPv6-address-Generation
The objective of this project is to enhance the security during auto-configuration of link local IPv6 address for overcoming threats and vulnerabilities in neighbor discovery. This system is implemented in the Linux operating system. The IPv6 module of the kernel is customized to implement HAVEGE algorithm for generating highly empirical random numbers which are used in the stateless address auto-configuration process for generating and assigning IPv6 addresses to the nodes.
